ddbencode coding style guidelines
=================================

Platform
--------

All code must be valid C99. Avoid GNU extensions.

Text
----

All text and source code must be ASCII, or, if not possible, UTF-8. Use Unix line endings. When writing text, put one space (not two) after punctuation. Avoid trailing whitespace.

Naming
------

...

Comments
--------

Use comments liberally. //-style comments are allowed and encouraged.

Indenting and bracing
---------------------

Use tabs to indent; use spaces to align.

Keep indentation levels to a minimum to improve readability. Bail out of a block as soon as possible. Bad example:

	public void foo()
	{
		if(bar)
		{
			if(baz)
			{
				blah();
			}
		}
	}

Good example:

	public void foo()
	{
		if(!bar)
			return;
		if(!baz)
			return;
	
		blah();
	}

Braces always start on a new line. Do not put braces around blocks with only one statement.

Do not put spaces after a function name in a function call. Do not put a space after a keyword that is followed by a left parenthesis. Place spaces around operators such as `==` and `<`. Do not place spaces inside parentheses.
